        "Deep underground, in a chamber tucked away where no one would come without a purpose, sealed inside a small cylindrical object lied a body.",
        "Hidden in the darkness and surrounded by silence, it rested there, showing no sign of life as the cold's gentle lullaby kept it under its spell.",
        "It would remain like that for days, weeks, moths, years even. Time didn't matter for the resident of the object.",
        "It was all like a blink of an eye.",
        "The cold started to hive way to the heat as metallic sounds of the machines attached to the body awakened it. The air around it started moving again as the pod was opened, filling the space with the smell of metal and sulfur.",
        "So they need me again... – The resident thought.",
        "Power slowly surged into his body again, awakening the metal under the flesh as his vision was slowly filled by sequences of letters and numbers he never cared enough for to bother understanding.",
        "His eyes started to open, filled with a yellow glint that became the first light to grace his resting place in months. The sight slowly came back to him, just in time for him to witness the light from outside again.",
        "He new the drill by now, having been laid to rest and awakened hundreds of times by now, though recently he was being pulled out less and less frequently. Slowly, his arms started to push against the hatch of his pod. The white smoke covered the area, a small 3 by 3 meters worth of space.",
        "– Home sweet home… – He muttered under his breath.",
        "As soon as he took a step out of the pod, he reached his mechanical hand out to the one other person in the room. The medical staff member assigned to take care of his maintenance.",
        "He was an elderly man, with whitening hair and more then few wrinkles on his tired face. A pair of thick, round-framed glasses rested on his nose with a spotlessly clean lab-coat over his body and a metal tag attached to his right breast with his ID on it. MS-08-748325. He preferred Hubert",
        "– Rise and shine Vert. You've been under for long enough – The man was one of the few people he had any semblance of trust for. And not just because he regularly lies on his table with his insides out in the open. or at least, what little insides he had left",
        "– Definitely longer they you should. A month more in that freezer and your core temperature would start to drop – He said, taking Vert’s hand in his own and immediately sticking a needle through it.",
        "– What do they want this time? Finally decided to scrap me?",
        "– Oh, they wouldn’t be waking you up for that, I assure you. – The contents of the syringe he held were soon emptied into Vert’s arm, filling him with a sense of warmth that quickly spread through his whole body. A welcome feeling after exiting a crio-pod",
        "– It’s not like they tell me anything about what you guys do, just what you need to do it... There are some rumors going around the facility though...",
        "– What rumors? – Vert started to examine his body, stretching his arms and legs to make sure they still work as they should.",
        "– They were doing some experiments recently. Antimatter, teleportation, shit like that. The word is, the researcher in charge, along with some others on her team used the thing they worked on to run away. I’m guessing they want you to catch them and more then likely silence. Can't have their precious secrets leaking out, can they...",
        "– Great. Sounds like fun… – Hubert hooked him up to a small wrist computer he carried, pushing another needle into him, this time into his neck.",
        "-Well, that’s just a rumor. Nobody knows for sure other then the higher-ups... All I know is that a large portion of the research team F76 disappeared. Whether they run away or got 'reassigned' is a mystery to me – He removed the needle, wiping it clean of Vert's artificial blood before retracting it back into the computer.",
        "– Alright, everything seems to be in order. If you need me before moving out, my post got moved to 3-65b – With that said, he left through the metal door of his cell.",
        "Now left alone, Vert only sighed loudly, turning towards the dispenser device on the wall. He shot a sideways glance at the camera in the corner of the room as he pulled out a set of cloths and put them on. Just a plain pair of pants and gray shirt.",
        "It was barely large enough to fit on his body, but he would soon be stuffed into his usual gear, or whatever they want him to use on this mission so he didn’t bother himself with it.",
        "Before putting the clothes on, he took one more look into a mirror on the wall, staring at his body for a long while. It was still the same as the last time he saw it. Metal pieces and wires visible under the pale, artificial skin, in some places outright sticking out. Arms and legs completely mechanized, covered in gray, worn out casing. Eyes shining with a faint yellow light and white hair, completely devoid of any pigment.",
        "With a clenched fist he took one more look around the gray cell -that for the past 15 years was the closest thing to a home, ever since he was… ‘enlisted’- He stepped out.",
        "The world outside wasn’t any more colorful though. Just one set of colorless hallways after another, occasionally with some paint sprayed on a door to indicate the position of whoever can be found inside.",
        "Again, he never cared enough to learn the meaning of each one.",
        "All he needed to know right now was where to find the facility overseer’s office.",
        "On his way there he barely saw anyone. Or at least anyone that was alive. There sure seemed to be a lot of automated defense drones flying around whenever he was in the area.",
        "– I wonder why… – He thought sarcastically, passing by a defense robot. A bulky model, standing over a head taller then him. He remembered the thing only as a prototype from back when he was awakened last time. ",
        "He only occasionally saw another human passing by and in their eyes the ‘human’ part didn’t necessarily apply to him. For most, he was just like the robots patrolling the hallways and got the same treatment. ‘Don’t provoke or it will kill you’ kind of treatment. Not that he really blamed them for that.",
        "On this level, acting out in any way was a quick way to being 'reassigned'. The higher-ups made sure everyone working down here knows it’s not hard to replace them. There were however some… exceptions.",
        "He was one of them.",
        "That being said though, there were other means put in place to keep him in check. More... definitive means.",
        "As he was making his way down a hallway, he suddenly felt something bump right into him just as he was coming around a corner. It wasn’t a hard hit, didn’t even make him stumble backwards but the thing that run into him was a different story.",
        "- I-I’m sorry! - He heard a squeak.",
        "Looking down, he only caught a glimpse of red hair flying through the air as the object bouncing off him was sent falling towards the ground.",
        "It was a girl. Young one. Couldn’t have been older then 17. The ID plate she had didn't mach the ones seen around this level, it actually had her name on it. Lilah.",
        "– I-I’m really sorry, sir! I-I wasn’t looking where I’m going! - He raised his eyebrow, not saying a word as he helped her up, probably pulling on her arm more roughly then he should.",
        "– T-Thank you – with a nod, he walked around her and continued on his way.",
        "– Um… Can I ask for directions, sir? – Soon enough he could hear her running after him, prompting him to stop and turn back to her.",
        "– Could you please tell me where to find the overseer’s office? I was sent to receive new assignment from here but I can’t find my way around.",
        "Vert eyed her again. She was clearly a new face around here, and didn’t have a clue about what kind of place she ended up in. He looked right into her bright blue eyes, still untouched by this place, still looking forward to the future… He honestly envied her. The last time he could say he looked forward to the future was right before his enlistment.",
        "– That’s where I’m heading – Not saying more, he turned around and continued on his way. She was quick to follow after him, even if she struggled to keep up with his pace. He noticed her taking a glance at the ID tag attached to his shirt, clearly searching for his name.",
        "– Um… My name is Lilah. Nice to meet you, mister... – She reached her hand out to him. Vert took a quick look at it but made no move to shake it.",
        "– Vert – She seemed taken aback by the cold response and retracted her hand, lowering her eyes to the floor. For a while she remained quiet, not bothering him while they approached the overseer's office.",
        "– People around here are not a talkative bunch are they? – Again, he barely acknowledged she said anything, only giving her a short sideways glance. It's no wonder she would think that. He could count number of people he would speak to with any degree of regularity over the last 15 years on two hands. A third of them was no longer around.",
        "– I don't think I could work here for long... No offense but that's not the kind of environment I'm used to. – Vert abruptly stopped in his tracks. She did the same once she noticed that, taking a few more steps before turning around. Her eyes focused on him again.",
        "– You better get used to it then. Those who don't adjust quick enough tend to get demoted very fast. And the only place lower then here... is 'hell'... – He turned his face towards the door they stopped next to.",
        "– W-What do you... m-mean?",
        "– You'll figure things out soon enough. Hopefully... – Vert's eyes focused on the ID number inscribed the door. OS-03-519033. It wasn't the same one he saw last time.",
        "– Shame – He commented quietly. The previous overseer actually seemed to understand and respect him on some level.",
        "Not wasting a second, Vert placed his hand against a panel attached to the wall, prompting a scanning device to emerge from the ceiling above the door. It scanned both him and Lilah with a blue beam of light, confirming they are both allowed to enter and informing the overseer about their arrival.",
        "Lilah herself didn't seem to be expecting that kind of security, covering her eyes as the sharp light reached them. Vert was quick to move her hand away, thus allowing the scanner to see her face.",
        "– Don't do that – Were the device unable to fully confirm her identity, she would... well, they had a fully armed drone that 'just happened' to be flying by them at time moment.",
        "The scan didn't take long to complete. Soon enough the panel under Vert's hand lit up and the door were opening before them.",
        "Vert stepped in first, with Lilah lagging slightly behind. She was still confused by everything she's heard from him, little as it was. Why was he so distant and cold? What did he mean by 'hell'? Why was he so heavily mechanized?",
        "The last one especially had her scratching her head. She did have a few minor implants to help her perform her tasks, but the cybernetic enhancements became available no more then three years ago and even minor implants like hers can take months to properly integrate.",
        "There simply shouldn't be enough time for him to become so heavily augmented, not to mention she has never even heard of someone with half as many implants as she was able to spot on him. And she had the idea that there was a lot more she couldn't see.",
        "As the questions continued bouncing off from each other inside her head, Vert halted in place, standing completely still in the middle of the room with his eyes focused on a figure sitting behind a desk in front of him.",
        "Lilah quickly stepped to his side, focusing her eyes on the figure. It was a woman. She didn't seem to even acknowledge their presence, keeping her piercing, green eyes focused squarely on the screen of her computer. At first, Lilah wanted to call out to the woman, but as she glanced over to Vert she noticed his complete lack of interest in taking action and decided to also wait in silence.",
        "As the sound of the overseer's fingers tapping against the keyboard filled the room, Lilah started to look around. The room was... definitely more decorated then the hallways she's been looking at since arriving on this level. Not exactly what she would expect from someone on such a high position within the whole organization.",
        "The 'decorations' spread around the room consisted merely of one barely watered plant gathering dust in a corner, a large cupboard filled with old, still not digitized files and a bookcase with more dust then books in it. Still, the room at least wasn't as gloom and colorless as the rest of the facility has led her to believe.",
        "– XS-95-000000 – The woman finally spoke, prompting Lilah to snap her attention back towards her. She was now looking at Vert with her hands resting on the desk. Vert said nothing, simply waiting for her to continue.",
        "– You've been reactivated on 9th of March, year 2309, Exactly three months and 5 days since you were previously stored withing crio-stasis pod. As of today, you are reassigned to active duty and will now receive your new assignment – She placed a large file in front of him, opening on the first page.",
        "Vert's attention was quickly directed towards a photograph of a woman printed on the page. A brunette with a visibly cybernetic left eye. It's yellow hue contrasted with the natural blue of her right eye, something that could easily be corrected with an additional shielding on the artificial lense, which the organization obviously doesn't deem necessary.",
        "Skimming through the page, Vert also noticed a mention of a cybernetic arm and leg, both implanted after a field test accident involving one of the new robots he's seen on the way here.",
        "He deduced she must be one of the more... 'important' people if the organization decided to invest resources into keeping her in working condition. Usually after sustaining this kind of injury, it's a one way road down to 'hell'.",
        "– This is HR-48-387245, also called Vallet by her team. Until recently she was among the most respected researchers on this level, however, as of now she is the firs person to organize and succeed in a mass desertion from the organization. That being said though, the situation is not nearly as bad as some of the rumors I've become aware of would suggest.",
        "– How so? – Vert finally decided to speak up.",
        "– Regardless of how you and those running this organization think we are serving the humanity as a whole, if even a ward on what is going on down here gets out...",
        "– She did not escape into the outside world – Overseer stopped him, slightly rising her hand. She took the file she laid in front of him back into her hands, opening it a few pages further before putting it back before him.",
        "– This has to do with the nature of her recent research. The project was initially suppose to improve the currant teleportation methods so that they incorporate living subjects, however it quickly turned into something much bigger and more meaningful. Something that provide humanity with possibilities we never even dreamed of... She broke through a dimensional barrier...",
        "– ...What? – Vert crooked his eyebrow. Out of all the things he has heard of, out of all the things this organization put its hands on that was the most... unbelievable. Not bizarre. At least not by the long shot, just... unbelievable.",
        "Lilah seemed to double that feeling as she stared at the overseer, wide-eyed in disbelief.",
        "– We are not concerned about her leaking out some of out... morally questionable endeavors, because she is not in a place where any of that would matter. She has crossed a bridge between worlds... and you will follow her there.",
        "Vert crossed his arms – And exactly what should I do once I'm there?",
        "W-Wait! Are you serious!? – Lilah suddenly spoke up, turning to face him as scratched her head in thought of what she just heard.",
        "– Now, wait just a second! You're just going to go along with this!? Without questioning something like this!?",
        "With a sigh, Vert turned towards her, making a small step in her direction – It's not my job to question things, my job is to get things done whether I like it or not.",
        "He returned his gaze to the overseer, who uncaringly stared at the young girl for a moment before focusing back on the matter at hand.",
        "– As of right now, our ability to use the device is... limited. It was sabotaged before HR-48-387245 made her escape and we managed to repair it to only a minimal operational capacity. We are be able to send a person through along some basic equipment as well as contact anything we send to the other side, but we are stretching the limits of what we currently are able to do with the device.",
        "– After you arrive on site, your task will be to find our missing personnel and bring them back alive. Should that prove impossible, all of the research data regarding the device was taken by one of the escapees. If it was not destroyed, recovering it will be a good enough alternative to aid us in repair efforts.",
        "– Understood. When will I be moving out?",
        "– Within 24 hours. You will need to be reequipped with adequate augments before going. MS-08-748325 will be waiting for you in his new office located in room 65b, section 3. Your equipment will be waiting in storage unit S-02, locker code 0269. You are dismissed.",
        "She turned towards Lilah, finally intentent on addressing her... However, it quickly became apparent that Vert had no desire to leave.",
        "– What about my team? – He asked, staring calmly into overseer's sharp eyes.",
        "– This is your team – She replied, motioning her hand at Lilah.",
        "– Lilah Maize, from now on RO-92-423986, has been reassigned permanently to this level. She will be you radio operator for the currant assignment and your connection to the base resources –As she said that, she pulled out a new ID plate and placed it in front of the girl, who took it in her hand and glanced at the ID number written on it. She quickly noticed that her name was not on it. Just like with all other plates she's seen since setting foot on the level.",
        "– W-what do you mean... permanently? – She was not given an answer, only multiplying her concerns. She looked to Vert in hope of some kind of explanation, or at least a reassurance that things are alright, but... reassurance is the opposite of what she saw.",
        "The calm, neutral exterior she's been seeing until now was almost completely gone. His eyes, which before only emanated with cold indifference, now blazed with pure anger as he glared daggers at the overseer. His hands were closed into fists, at times outright shaking from anger that had filled him.",
        "Lilah instinctively took a step back. He looked like a bomb about to explode, just barely holding back. The overseer however, didn't seem particularly affected by any of that. She merely eyed the man, pondering on whether she should even bother.",
        "– I'm asking about the unit under my command. SCU-01 – The sheer amount of venom that sipped into the tone of his voice made it seem like somewhere deep down, he already knew the answer. And that he didn't like it.",
        "The overseer remained silent for a while, matching Vert's boiling anger with a cold gaze – Through detailed evaluation of the unit's performance, it was determined that XS-96-000001, 000002, 000004 and 000005 did not perform as our organization expected and as such were removed from their posts.",
        "The very moment she spoke the last word, Vert was already closing in with his fist accelerating towards the overseer. His mechanical arm started to shift, parts of it moved aside as a quarter meter long blade extended from his wrist. It happened so fast, Lilah didn't even register it until a whole second after the blade stopped right in front of overseer's face.",
        "She released a shriek as she backed further away. Her body was shaking in fear, paralyzed in place and forced to watch the situation unfold...",
        "But... nothing happened. Vert's sudden burst came to a halt, along with his whole body. He was like a statue now, completely immobilized, frozen with his eyes still locked on the overseer's unfazed face.",
        "She sighed lightly, rising from her seat – I was made aware of your... problematic tendencies, but I did not expect you to be causing trouble this soon.",
        "Her hand rested on his arm, and just like that, the blade returned back into it – It's not like I don't understand you though. The circumstances of your introduction into the organization was certainly... unusual... and not something we would normally do. I can see how it would affect someone as young as you were at the time...",
        "She then placed her hand against his chest. The shirt he wore was suddenly ripped in two, as Vert's chest opened, revealing a large cylinder glowing in the middle right next to his still beating heart, closed in a glass containment.",
        "– But what we did, just as everything else we do serves one goal and one goal alone. Progression of the human race. And for that goal we are willing to sacrifice a lot. One or two lives, innocent or not, do not make a difference.",
        "Slowly, her hand started to reach for the cylinder embedded into his chest. She removed it from it's socket, and just like that, Vert's whole body just collapsed to the ground. The faint yellow glow of his eyes disappeared, replaced by dull, gray husks that showed no sign of life.",
        "– You were the first human successfully enhanced with cybernetics. The first one to survive the operation and the one to pave way for the development of human enhancement technology... You may have felt that to an extent you re untouchable... that we can't afford to simply lose you... Well, allow me to set things straight for you.",
        "She looked at the cylinder in her hand. The heat coming off of it had begun to melt down the artificial skin covering her hand and arm. The silver metal started to show more and more as she crushed the cylinder in her hand, spilling ble liquid that filled it on the floor. Sparks started to fly around the room and as she looked down on Vert's body, lying motionlessly on the floor, her eyes turned yellow.",
        "– You are no longer irreplaceable...",
        "– You are not even the best we have...",

        "A sunrise is seen by many as something to look forward to. A beautiful spectacle of sun slowly emerging from the horizon, spreading its light on the land covered in darkness. A sign of life's cycle starting anew with the beginning of another day.",
        "Birds sung, forest creatures awakened, people rose to start their work... The markets would soon start to open and pedestrians would fill the streets. Everything was starting to move again; to live.",
        "And among all that, one person remained completely still.",
        "Even as the world around her continued to rush forward, she stayed behind, hiding from the light of a new day, ignoring others who moved around her. ",
        "When others saw the beginning of a new day, all she did was wonder when it will end. When they admired it's beauty, she tugged on the chains that kept her shrouded in darkness. When other saw the sunrise as the start of a new day, she saw it as the end of another sleepless night.",
        "She felt an involuntary sigh escape past her lips as the cold wind pulled on her long, black hair. The first rays of light were just about to reach her bloodshot eyes, but just as she saw sun's shape come into view, she rose back on her feet.",
        "Just as she was about to leave the rooftop atop which she was standing a sudden jolt of pain spread through her left arm, halting her in place for a brief second before she regained her composure. The arm was hanging on a sling, wrapped in bandages. The pain would appear periodically, reminding her what's under the bandages, as well as why she never wanted it.",
        "Holding onto her still hurting arm, she jumped down from the rooftop onto a balcony of the same building. She pushed the balcony door open and stepped inside, carefully stepping on the wooden planks under her feet to not make noise.",
        "Not that it necessarily mattered. Her two housemates were not exactly light sleepers like she was. In fact, if the house wasn't located so close to the upper city, she would actually be hesitant to leave the house for longer then a couple of hours.",
        "The city militia was patrolling the area nearly at all times of day and many of them knew her by name, so the safety of her family was not a concern for her.",
        "House itself was... also not a concern for her. It was just large enough to do the job, placed just in the right place for every important spot in the city to remain close enough, just easy enough to clean to not be a bother. It was also not hers. Never was, and never will be.",
        "As far as she cared, it was just a roof over her head and a place to keep her sister safe. Nothing more and nothing less. ",
        "She stepped into the kitchen, rising her right hand above her hand as she steeped over a crystal lamp above her head. With a snap of her fingers, a spark traveled from her hand to the small crystal, which lit up with yellow light as soon as the spark reached it. Immediately, the pain in her left hand pulsed again, as it always does when she starts using magic.",
        "She could have simply used the thing as it was intended to be used, just by flipping the switch, not many humans could use magic after all. The crystal was already charged with magic, ready to be used, it just... didn't feel natural to her.",
        "Her abilities were a part of her ever since she was just a child, denying herself the ability to use them just because it hurts a bit didn't sit right with her.",
        "It would all be over soon anyways. Just a few more hours of this and she would be rid of those damned bandages. What rests underneath them would have to remain though, as much as she didn't like it.",
        "She grabbed yesterday's loaf of bread and started cutting it down into several slices, each soon to be decorated with cheese and tomatoes. Just as she was about to start eating though, she heard the floor creaking behind her.",
        "– Yavin... – She turned around, immediately coming face to face with her younger sister, who stood in the doorway, rubbing her eyes. The girl was younger then her by a couple of years, but often it was hard to tell. They were of almost the same height, with black hair, blue eyes and nearly identical faces. The only two substantial differences people really noticed were their body builds and length of their hair.",
        "Yavin was in a better shape then her younger sibling by a huge margin, having trained physically for years while her counterpart has spent most of her life bedridden. She also chose to keep her hair a fair bit longer, with her sister's barely touching down on her shoulders, while Yavin's own came down all the way to her waist.",
        "– Go back to bed, it's early – Yavin said, taking the first bite of her breakfast.",
        "– I'll be spending half a day in bed on anyways, I'm getting enough rest. You sure as hell don't though... How long have you been up?",
        "She came up to her and took hold of what was left of the bread loaf – Don't eat yet. I'll grab something fresh for you on my way back.",
        "– Ah, yeah... I almost forgot it's today. I hope you'll be able to sleep better without this thing around your hand. Not that you ever did...",
        "That was... absolute truth. Ever since she had to take care of both of them her sleeping schedule has become... strained, to say the least. It was at least manageable before as long as she was able to help herself with magic but now with the bandages restraining her use of it, things were getting worse. It's been going on for over a month now and the dark bags under her eyes were a clear proof.",
        "– Why did you even decide to do this to your hand? You never needed Crystallizing to use magic and with it you'll need to relearn half of what you already know. What's the point?",
        "Yavin stayed quiet for a second, using food in her hand as an excuse to do so – It's nothing you should concern yourself with.",
        "The room got... quiet all of a sudden. Yavin could almost hear her sister's weak heartbeat as the atmosphere between them grew... awkward. In the midst of the silence, they suddenly heard the floor creaking again. It was their dog who woke up to see what the commotion was all about. They named him Anoth and he was a large one, with his head reaching up over their hips while on all fours, almost a meter off the ground. To top it off, his thick, brown fur only made him seem bigger then he already is.",
        "On some level he must have sensed the tension in the room and prompted to simply sit down on the side and wait to see what happens.",
        "– Why do you always say this... – Yavin heard her sister speaking up. She had her back turned to the girl, already aware she will have no answers to give her.",
        "– Shili, I...",
        "– No! You always do this! You always tell me to just lay in bed while you leave to do spirits know what! – She smashed her hand against the table as her outburst continued – I'm not suppose to be concerned with WHAT!? With you!? You're my sister! You're all I have left, and half the time I don't know what you do or even where you are! You leave me alone for days, months even and you never told me why!",
        "Yavin snapped her face towards her sister. She was getting a really bed feeling about where this was all heading. Anoth seemed to be having the same feeling as she did as he rose from the sitting position.",
        "– Shili, calm down. Everything is fine, I promise – She tried to calm her down, but only seemed to make things worse. Shili pointed her finger at her sister as she continued to scream, even more aggravated now. She didn't notice her body shivering, but Yavin certainly did.",
        "You've been saying this over and over for the past 10 years! Ever since father died I've only seen you struggle more and more each day and ever since we started living here... If you think I don't hear you crying on the rooftop, you are wrong!",
        "Her face was getting red and her breath grew ragged. With each word her body was starting to shiver more and more. Anoth has started to bark at her, clearly feeling that something is wrong.",
        "– Why can't you just tell me!? Do you think I'll hate you? That I won't understand? I swear, I'll-!",
        "She suddenly went dead quiet, holding her hand up against her chest – Shili! – Yavin rushed to her sister just as she started to fall over. She immediately took the girl into her arms and rushed towards her room. Her boot smashed against the door, kicking them open and with one quick move headed towards Shili's bed. The girl was gasping for breath as she still held onto her chest, clearly in great pain.",
        "Yavin quickly shuffled through her sister's nightstand, finding a small bottle of yellow liquid placed alongside a green crystal. She poured the contents of the bottle into Shili's mouth and threw it away, now taking hold of the crystal.",
        "Closing her hand into a fist, she charged it with magic as it was turned into small fragments in her hand. The crushed fragments started giving away faint green light and she quickly proceeded to place them on Shili's chest, pushing them into her body with her hand.",
        "The light soon started to disappear along with the crystal's remains. Shili's breath has returned to normal, but she was barely able to keep her eyes open. The pain in her chest was still there, but the medicine made it manageable. She felt Anoth climbing on top of her bed, lying his big snout on her stomach, whimpering quietly.",
        "–Yavin... – She spoke up to her sister, who sat down on the bed beside her – Please... Don't leave me too...",
